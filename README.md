# UTC Time Converter

This helper tool determines UTC time. It is designed to support my Twilio SMS Blaster tool by providing the correct UTC time for scheduling SMS and MMS messages.

## Overview

The tool displays the current Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and lets you convert any given date and time from a local time zone to UTC. This is useful because the Twilio SMS Blaster expects scheduled times in UTC.

## How to Use

1. Open the website in your browser.
2. The tool shows the current UTC time.
3. In the conversion section, enter a date, time, and your local time zone.
4. Click "Convert" to get the corresponding UTC time.
5. Use the UTC time in your scheduling with the Twilio SMS Blaster.
